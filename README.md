Hello there,

My name is Ariel, born and raised in Israel, located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

I'm in the process of graduating from a very intensive full stack web development course (more details will be shared on a later date...)

Before that, I worked for HP for many years, initially as a SW developer (C++ under Windows, InstallShield, Perl) and later as an Application Support Engineer and Trainer.
